# Explain the value of Public Cloud

Cloud computing is the **on-demand** delivery of IT resources **over the Internet** with **pay-as-you-go** pricing. 

Instead of buying, owning, and maintaining physical data centers and servers, you can access technology services, such as computing power, storage, and databases, on an as-needed basis from a cloud provider like Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft (Azure), or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). The companies the provide Cloud Computing are also knows as **Cloud Service Providers (CSP)**

Organizations of every type, size, and industry are using the cloud for a wide variety of use cases, such as data backup, disaster recovery, email, virtual desktops, software development and testing, big data analytics, and customer-facing web applications. For example, healthcare companies are using the cloud to develop more personalized treatments for patients. Financial services companies are using the cloud to power real-time fraud detection and prevention. And video game makers are using the cloud to deliver online games to millions of players around the world.

# Understand how cloud computing differs from on-premises model and how to use it

Unlike a traditional company where you build or buy servers, storage, and networking equipment, you **consume** what you need either as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). There is no need to buy any physical equipment as all the consumption (or Delivery) is done over the internet.

IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS are also called **Delivery/Service Models**

## Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

IaaS very closely relates to a traditional computing model that we discussed above. IaaS has the basic building blocks for cloud IT and typically provide access to networking features, servers, and data storage space.

## Platform as a Service (PaaS)

Say you do not want to manage the underlying **infrastructure** like Servers, PaaS allows you to consume the Service directly for example a database so you can quickly build your applications. This helps you be more efficient as you don’t need to worry about resource procurement, capacity planning, software maintenance, patching, or any of the other undifferentiated heavy lifting involved in running your application.

## Software as a Service (SaaS)

SaaS is the most comprehensive form of cloud computing services, delivering an entire application that is managed by a cloud service provider, via a web browser. 

Your email account can be considered a SaaS service. The advantage of SaaS is that it allows you to focus on consumption without worrying about any maintenance. 

SaaS is a great option for small businesses who don’t have the staff or bandwidth to handle software installation and updates, as well as for applications that don’t require much customization or that will only be used periodically.
