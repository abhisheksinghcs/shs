# Shared responsibility model

The model defines the security responsibility between the CSP and its customers. This responsibility changes depending on the delivery/ service model.

Understanding this model will help you in designing systems that are secure and would be able to leverage the security provided by CSP. An example of a security control that customers inherit from CSP is security of the physical security of the Data Center where customers' environment is hosted. Similarly, customer is responsible for securing the Server (EC2) that they launch on CSP (AWS).

In case of IaaS the customer has a large responsibility vs. SaaS where CSP pretty much secures the entire application and customer usually is only responsibile for configuration.
