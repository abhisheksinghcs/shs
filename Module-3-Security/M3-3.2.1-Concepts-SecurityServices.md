# Core security concepts

* [Users](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_users.html): Is an entity that you create in AWS
* [Roles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html): Defines what a user/identity can or cannot do on AWS
* [Encryption](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption): A process that converts the original representation of the information, known as plaintext, into an alternative form known as ciphertext. Ideally, only authorized parties can decipher a ciphertext back to plaintext and access the original information 
* [Logging](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/awscloudtrail/latest/userguide/cloudtrail-user-guide.html): Recording actions taken by a user, role, or an AWS service 
* [Best practices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/latest/userguide/fsbp-standard.html): Describes how you should apply security across your AWS ennvrionment
