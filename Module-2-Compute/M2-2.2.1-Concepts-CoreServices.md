# AWS Regions and Zones
**AWS Regions** are separate geographic areas that AWS uses to house its infrastructure. These are distributed around the world so that customers can choose a region closest to them in order to host their cloud infrastructure there. The closer your region is to you, the better, so that you can reduce network latency as much as possible for your end-users. You want to be near the data centers for fast service.

An AWS **Availability Zone (AZ)** is the logical building block that makes up an AWS Region.

## Networking
* **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC):** Allows you to launch AWS resources in isolated environment. 
  Let's look at the [design](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html) 

## Compute
* **Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2):** Basically your server in Cloud. 
  Let's review the [design](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/concepts.html)
   
## Storage

* **Relational Database Service (RDS):** Amazon RDS offers managed database services for various relational database engines like MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server. It automates routine tasks like patching, backups, and scaling.
